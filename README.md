"# The-Dining-Philosophers-Problem-But-With-Xbox-Controllers-" 

"#Five students are sitting at a round table. In front of the students is a prototype of the 
Xbox Series Y. Between each pair of students is one controller. Before an individual 
student can play the Xbox, he must have two controllers, one taken from the left, and 
one taken from the right. The students must find some way to share controllers so that 
they all get to play. "
